##SDK
setup android SDK - <https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#download>

##In git bash
	cd "whatever directory you want"
	git clone git@github.com:thepiper/appydroid.git

open up the eclipse included with the SDK, set the workspace to the directory you used, kapeesh.

There will be some shenanigans involving where you installed the android SDK, when you set the directory for the first time, there will be a popup where you can just select the place you installed the SDK, and things should work.
